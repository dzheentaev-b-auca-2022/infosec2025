I would like to bring to your
attention the insolent behaviour,
in class, of Mr Potter.
The following reprimandable incidents
occurred under my authority:
1- Potter shouted at me in class.
2- Potter called me a liar in class.
3- Potter alleged that He who must
not be named has returned.
I trust you will consider these
transgressions with due severity.
